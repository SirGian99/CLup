\chapter{Introduction}
    
    \section{Purpose}
    CLup aims to provide chains of stores with a reliable solution to the problem of people gathering inside and outside the shops. \par
    To face the problem, the application focuses on its principal causes, which are the management of people inside the store, that often leads to overcrowding, the effectiveness of standard queuing systems and the way people are allowed to visit the stores. Moreover, the system aims to provide a useful tool for store managers in order to help them in administering stores and monitoring their status. In particular, the main goals that CLup aims to achieve, summarized in the table below, are the following: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prevent the store from being overcrowded, in order to avoid indoor gatherings while maximizing its occupancy, by means of an access management system;
        \item Reduce gatherings of people waiting to enter outside the store, providing a way to virtualize queues;
        \item Provide a more efficient way to access stores, reducing the time customers waste while waiting to do it;
        \item Help store managers in monitoring the status of the store and regulating the influx of people.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Scope}
    During the current situation of emergency, it is fundamental to prevent contacts among people. For this reason, governments impose strict rules concerning social distancing, both for indoor and outdoor contexts. \par
    However, crowding management inside stores like supermarkets and grocery shops could be challenging. Currently, stores limit the maximum number of people allowed, and therefore long queues arise: entering a store for a few minutes might even require hours. Moreover, customers who see a crowded store might avoid lining up to save time and prevent contact with others. \par
    CLup fits into this context allowing customers to remotely line up in a queue of a given store and to be notified when they should head toward it. Furthermore, it allows the customer to book a visit for a store on a specific day and time, which grants him priority over the queued customer. \par
    Users can interact with CLup thanks to two distinct interfaces: one is an easy-to-use application designed for the customers, while the other one is an administrative tool that allows store managers to monitor their stores and modify their parameters. \par
    Moreover, CLup also provides physical proxies outside the stores as a fallback option for users who want to line up but do not have access to the application.

\chapter{Overall description}
    \section{Product perspective}
    \subsection{UML Class Diagram Description}
    The provided UML Class Diagram is intended to provide a high-level model of the reality in which CLup is collocated. The following description aims to better highlight the main characteristics of the model. \par
    CLup is intended to manage stores of different chains. In particular each store, which is composed of different product sections, is associated with its managers and with the chain it belongs to. A store is also characterized by its name, its address, its maximum occupancy, its working hours and its product sections, which are parameters specified by store managers. Moreover, other significant attributes inferred by the system are the store current occupancy and the average time customers spend inside it.  \par
    Each product section is identified by its name and is characterized by a current occupancy and by a maximum occupancy. \par
    Customers can visit the store by making a visit request, and are divided into app-customers and proxy customers. \par
    A visit request has different attributes, such as the number of people willing to visit the store and the visit token that will allow them to visit it. CLup provides two kinds of visit requests: line-up requests and booking requests. \par
    Each store maintains a queue of line-up requests, characterized by its length and its estimated disposal time, and holds booking requests made by app-customers. \par
    Booking requests are characterized by attributes such as the date and time requested by the customer and the expected duration of the visit. Moreover, each booking request can also be associated with the store product sections that the app-customer has specified while placing the booking.

    \subsection{Scenarios}
        \subsubsection{Remotely line up for a store}
        Alice is at home and wants to do some grocery shopping at the store at the end of the street. She opens CLup and checks the store’s current queue and the estimated time required to enter. She decides to get in line and starts doing something else. After some time, she receives a notification that suggests her to start heading the store. Thus, she reaches the store. Once there, she opens the app and notices that it is her turn,  so she retrieves the visit token in the app in order to get access to the store. When she is done with her shopping and payment, she opens the app in order to exit the store.
        \subsubsection{Line up for a store using the proxy}
        Bob is a 70-year-old man who is not so keen on using a smartphone, so he has not got any. He has to buy something at the minimarket near his house. He uses the proxy located outside the store to line up and to receive a visit token, and then waits along the street waiting for his turn to come. When it is his turn, he is informed by the Turn Announcement System of the store and enters it by showing the visit token to the Access Management System.  When he is done with his shopping and payment, he uses the visit token in order to exit the store.
        \subsubsection{Booking a visit for a store}
        Chuck is at work and he wants to do some shopping before coming back home. Since there are often many people in line to enter the store he wants to go to, he opens the CLup client and books a visit to the store for a specific time interval. Before reaching the store he must pick up his son from school, so he specifies that two people will visit it. When the time arrives, they have priority over the people in the queue. Since it is their turn, Chuck opens the app in order to get access to the store. After the payment, he opens the app in order to exit the store.
        \subsubsection{Active suggestions for long-term customers}
        Isaac wants to book a visit for Saturday at noon at his local shop. Since he is a long term customer of that chain of stores, CLup provides him with an estimated duration of his visit, based on data about his previous visits. However, the system also informs him that, for the selected time interval, the store is often crowded, and so suggests to him different alternatives. Sadly, George can only do shopping in the indicated one, so he places his booking anyway.
        \subsubsection{Booking alternatives are suggested}
        Emanuele lives near a store in “via Rubattino” and wants to do some grocery shopping next Saturday morning at 11 a.m. However, that store is already at its maximum occupancy in the selected time interval due to previous bookings by other users. So, when Emanuele tries to place a Booking Request, the system provides him with two alternatives: the first one is to book a visit on the same day at 6 p.m., when the store, according to bookings and statistics, will be less crowded; the second one is to book a visit for the same time interval in another store of the same chain, which has not reached its maximum occupancy yet. Emanuele chooses an option and fulfils his need. 
        \subsubsection{There is always a way out}
        Giancarlo is a customer who is currently visiting a store. While in the store, he notices that his phone ran out of battery. After he is done with his shopping, he asks for the help of a store manager, who manually allows him to exit the shop. The occupancy of the shop is then automatically updated.
    
    \section{Product Functions}
    CLup is intended to reach the goals introduced in Section 1.1. \par
    It regulates the influx of people in a store to prevent it from being overcrowded. To do so, CLup provides a way to authorize the entrances to the shop with respect to the number of people inside it. \par
    CLup uses unique visit tokens to authorize each customer to enter and exit the store. If the customer uses the application, the visit token will be available in the application itself. Instead, each time a customer uses the proxy of a given store, a visit token is physically provided by the proxy itself. All the accesses are granted with respect to the store maximum occupancy. \par
    The store maximum occupancy, its product sections and relative maximum occupancy, the name, the address and the working hours of the store are all parameters that CLup allows managers to specify through the administrative tool. Furthermore, managers can also use the tool to monitor the status of the shop, which includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the number of people inside;
        \item the visits which are actually in progress;
        \item the average duration of a visit;
        \item the actual length and estimated disposal time of the queue;
        \item all the future booking requests.
    \end{itemize}
    In order to reduce the possibility of queues forming outside the store, CLup provides the possibility to remotely line up in a queue. A customer can join the queue either using the application offered by CLup or by means of the proxy placed outside the store. To reduce the risk of people reaching the store too early or too late, the system allows customers to see the number of people ahead of them. It also provides a reasonably precise estimation of the waiting time both before and after joining the queue. Furthermore, CLup alerts app-customers when they need to reach the store, taking into account the time they need to get to the shop from their current position with respect to the time at which they will be authorized to enter it. Eventually, the system informs customers when they are allowed to enter the store through the Turn Announcement System and, for app-customers, also through the application. \par
    An app-customer can also use the application to book a visit to the shop. Doing so, he has to specify when he wants to reach the store, the expected duration of the visit and, if he wants, which kind of products he intends to buy. In case of long-term customers, the estimated duration of the visit, based on the already completed one of the same customer, can also be provided by CLup. \par
    All these data are used by the system to manage who can enter the store in a specific time interval. \par
    When a booking is placed, the system can also decide to reject it if, across the specified time interval, the bookings placed by other customers already maximize the store occupancy. The system also tries to balance the number of customers across all the working hours of the store. In both cases, it suggests alternative time intervals or alternative stores of the same chain when a customer is booking a visit. \par
    CLup is able to manage the case in which, for any reason, a customer does not show up while he is allowed to enter the store and other people are waiting to enter it. Moreover, app-customers can always cancel their visit requests (both line-up and booking requests), if needed. \par
    App-customers can choose to be notified about the availability of specified stores. Indeed, a customer can specify one or more recurrent time intervals in which he is interested in visiting the store. These intervals can also be inferred by the system based on the customer’s attitudes. The system will notify him if, during one of those time intervals, the store is reaching its maximum occupancy. Doing so, the customer can take the opportunity to visit the store by booking or lining up. \par
    CLup monitors customer attitudes also to estimate the average visit duration of each store

    \section{User characteristics}
    \subsubsection{Store manager}: he modifies its store’s parameters, such as the working hours and the maximum occupancy. He also specifies the different product sections that compose the store and their relative maximum occupancies. He can also keep track of the real-time store occupancy, and might let people in and out of the store, if needed.
    \subsubsection{Customer}: he uses CLup in order to visit a store of a given chain. To do so, he can either line up in the CLup queue, by means of the application or the proxy, or also book a visit through the application. 
    \subsubsection{Access Management System}: it is the system which regulates physical entrances and exits to the store it is associated with. It communicates with CLup in order to determine if a customer is allowed to enter it or not, and informs CLup whether the visit begins or ends.
    \subsubsection{Turn Announcement System}: it receives information from CLup about customers allowed to enter the store it is associated with, in order to inform the ones waiting outside the store.

    \subsection{Hardware interfaces}
    \subsubsection{Customer's device} 
    The customer is supposed to use a smartphone to interact with CLup. In order to interact with the system, the smartphone should have an internet connection.
    
    \subsubsection{Manager's device} 
    The manager is supposed to use a smartphone or a personal computer to interact with CLup. In order to interact with the system, they should have an internet connection.
    
    \subsubsection{Proxy} 
    Since the proxy should provide customers with an easy way to line up, it must have at least:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An internet connection
        \item A way to allows customers to make a line-up request for a single person
        \item A way to physically provide them with the visit token associated with the line-up request
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Turn Announcement System}
    It should offer an interface that allows CLup to inform it about the needed information to be provided to the customers.
    
    \subsubsection{Access Management System}
    CLup provides a set of APIs to be used by the Access Management System in order to authorize the visit of a customer and inform CLup about the beginning and ending of the visit.
    
    \subsection{Software interfaces}
    \subsubsection{Map API's}
    In order to properly send notifications, the system must estimate the time needed for the customer to reach the store. Thus, a map service should be used to get that estimation based on the customer current position.

    \section{Performance requirements}
    The system, in normal operating conditions, should be able to handle all line-up and booking requests of each customer. It should be able to manage, without a loss in performance, a large number of simultaneous visit requests which, in a non optimal case, are likely to be in the order of the sum of all maximum occupancies of each store managed by CLup. \par
    The system responses and notifications must be sent within 3 seconds from the triggering event.
    
    \section{Design constraints}
    \subsection{Standard compliance}
    The whole software should be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    
    \section{Software system attributes}
    \subsection{Reliability}
    The context in which CLup operates is characterized by a strong focus on safety and distancing between people. Thus, the system must guarantee a high degree of reliability in order to prevent dangerous situations in which safety constraints are violated both inside and outside the store. 
    
    \subsection{Availability}
    In order to help the store manager to regulate the influx of people to the store and prevent gatherings, CLup should be available the 99\% of the time.
    
    \subsection{Security}
    The system should focus on protecting against attacks which affect its availability and reliability. It is also fundamental to protect both customers and managers from man-in-the-middle attacks. They should exchange messages and information only with CLup, while keeping private information safe (e.g. customer’s current position and future movements).
    
    CLup shall also identify all of the store managers before allowing them to use the store administrative tool.
    
    \subsection{Maintainability}
    Over time, the system could need corrections, improvements and additions. For this reason, the system must be well-documented and adaptable to changes.
    
    \subsection{Portability}
    The CLup application should be compatible with most of the mobile devices and personal computers currently on the market. This way, everyone can benefit from the system, save time and avoid crowding by queuing remotely and by booking visits. \par
    Moreover, CLup should be platform independent in order to increase degrees of freedom when choosing the hardware to use and its possible future upgrades.
    
    \subsection{Accessibility}
    The application should be easy to use, in order to allow all the different possible customers to visit the store.
    
    \section{Other requirements}
    CLup shall give priority to booking requests over line-up requests. \par
    Customers can remotely line up in a store’s queue only if they are not in the queue of any store at that moment. \par
    Customers can book a visit for a specific time interval only if they have not booked any other visit which overlaps that time interval. \par
    Customers can book a visit for a specific time interval only if it starts before the current queue disposal time. 

\chapter{Alloy}
    \section{Alloy description}
    The Alloy model presented below aims to show how it is possible to build a coherent and consistent solution to the problem explained in this document, taking into account all the already specified constraints. To do so, the Alloy model neglects some aspects of the UML that are not strictly useful to do this kind of analysis, while focusing on the principal behaviours of the system. \par
    As it can be seen by executing the “show” predicate, which includes some constraints of convenience on the number of instances of some signatures, all the specified facts allow to build a feasible instance of the problem that is coherent with all the requirements and constraints. \par
    For the sake of simplicity, time intervals and time in general are represented using integers, and the behaviour of product sections with respect to their maximum occupancy is not deeply investigated . Furthermore, the signatures “Date” and “Token” are not deeply characterized for the same simplicity reasons. \par
    In particular, the model shows that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a visit can take place only after its request has been placed;
        \item a customer can line-up only for a store at a time;
        \item a customer cannot visit more than one store at the same time;
        \item a customer cannot book two overlapping time intervals among all the stores;
        \item it is not possible to book a visit if that booking would make the store exceed its maximum occupancy;
        \item it is not possible to book a visit which does not fits in the store working hours;
        \item it is not possible to book a visit that starts before the current queue disposal time;
        \item it is not possible to line up when the store is closed;
        \item the current store occupancy is the number of people in the store at that moment;
        \item tokens, manager ids and product sections are unique.
    \end{itemize}
